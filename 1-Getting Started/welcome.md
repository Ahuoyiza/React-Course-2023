# Welcome to the React course.
I am thrilled to have you join us on this exciting journey of mastering React, from the very basics to advanced concepts. This course is designed to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of React and empower you to build robust and scalable web applications.

Throughout this course, we will dive deep into the fundamentals of React, exploring its core concepts and principles. You will gain hands-on experience with React components, JSX syntax, state management, props, and event handling. We will guide you through the process of building interactive and dynamic user interfaces using React's powerful capabilities.

As we progress, we will move beyond the basics and venture into more advanced topics. You will learn about advanced state management techniques, hooks, context API, and routing. We will cover best practices and patterns for building reusable and maintainable React applications.

In addition to theory, we believe in the power of practice. Along the way, you will work on practical projects and coding exercises that will solidify your understanding and allow you to apply your knowledge in real-world scenarios. You'll have the opportunity to tackle challenges and develop the skills necessary to tackle complex React applications with confidence.
There are 3 different practice modes available:
1. Class activities: Fork the repository, Code along with the instructor (on the project associated with the session)
send a pr once you're done.
2. Projects: Released every sunday and more robust than the class activities. You will create your own repo, follow the project instructions, implement your soltuion, add me as a collaborator and submit the repo url.
3. Extra Practices: Out of class easy bite practices with detailed guide on how to execute.

By the end, you will have the expertise to build professional-grade React applications and stand out in the world of web development.

So, get ready to unlock the full potential of React! Let's embark on this learning adventure together and take your React skills to new heights.

Best of luck, and enjoy the course!
